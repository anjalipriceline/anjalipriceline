# 👋 Hi, I'm Anjali Raj

💳 **Chargebacks & Payments Ops** by day  
⚙️ **DevOps** by night  
☁️ Breaking things in prod (responsibly)

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a DevOps engineer working in the **payments/chargebacks** space, where money is real, latency matters, and mistakes are ✨educational✨.

I live at the intersection of:
- Fraud & chargeback workflows  
- Cloud infrastructure  
- Automation that saves everyone from manual pain  

If it can be automated, containerized, or yelled at until it behaves — I’m on it.

## 🛠️ Tech I Touch (and Occasionally Fight With)

- **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, EKS, S3, IAM, CloudWatch)
- **Containers:** Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **IaC:** Terraform
- **Scripting:** Bash, Python
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis

---

## 💼 What I Work On

- Scaling chargeback processing pipelines  
- Making infra boring, reliable, and cheap  
- Reducing “who broke prod?” meetings  
- Building guardrails so finance teams don’t panic  

---

## 🧠 Current Interests

- Platform engineering
- Cost optimization (FinOps but make it DevOps)
- Observability that actually tells the truth
- Chaos engineering (controlled chaos… mostly)

---

## ☕ Fun Facts

- I trust logs more than people  
- `kubectl` is muscle memory  
- If it works on the first deploy, I don’t trust it
